C++ is a compiled language 
the compiler converts it in an executible file and executing the file gives the output

it is strictly typed
it has a garbage collector which uses mark and sweep algorithm
it is a case sensitive language

to run the file
1. g++ [filename]
2. ./[name of .out file]

VARIABLES 

variable is written in cpp with the data type and the identifier (name given by the user)

primitive data types : 
1. int -> integer number -> takes 4 bytes
3. float -> floating point numbers -> 4 bytes
7. long double -> even bigger float  -> 12-16 bytes
5. double -> larger floating numbers   -> 8 bytes
2. char -> characters stored in form or ASCII values  -> 1 byte
4. bool -> true or false -> 1 byte
6. void -> empty type, does not return anything -> 	0 bytes

the constant variables are stored in capital letters e.g. PI

TYPE CONVERSION -> type conversion and type casting 

type conversion is automatically done by the compiler in which a smaller data type is stored as the larger data type
