C++ is a compiled language 
the compiler converts it in an executible file and executing the file gives the output

it is strictly typed
it has a garbage collector which uses mark and sweep algorithm
it is a case sensitive language

to run the file
1. g++ [filename]
2. ./[name of .out file]

VARIABLES 

variable is written in cpp with the data type and the identifier (name given by the user)

primitive data types : 
1. int -> integer number -> takes 4 bytes
3. float -> floating point numbers -> 4 bytes
7. long double -> even bigger float  -> 12-16 bytes
5. double -> larger floating numbers   -> 8 bytes
2. char -> characters stored in form or ASCII values  -> 1 byte
4. bool -> true or false -> 1 byte
6. void -> empty type, does not return anything -> 	0 bytes

the constant variables are stored in capital letters e.g. PI

TYPE CONVERSION -> type conversion and type casting 

type conversion is automatically done by the compiler (implicit) in which a smaller data type is stored as the larger data type 

type casting is manually done (explicit) to store a bigger data type in a smaller one 

in cpp 100.1 -> 101 , 100.99 -> 101

* until you initialize the variable in cpp it will have a garbage value

OPERATORS OPERATOR


ARTHEMATIC
sum -> +
diff -> -
product -> *
divide -> /
modulus -> %

while dividing the int numbers the decimal points are not there in the output 
to get the decimal precision we can use the float or double data types or else we can type cast

RELATIONAL OPERATOR 

> -> greater than 
>= -> greater than equal to
< -> less than 
<= -> less than equal to
== -> equals to
= -> assignment 
!= -> not equal to

the relational operators always return true or false 
the true and false are represented by 1 and 0 respectively

LOGICAL OPERATOR

! -> NOT 
|| -> OR 
&& -> AND
