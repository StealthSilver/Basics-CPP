VECTORS

STL -> standard template library of C++ (it contains stack, hashTable, vectors and queue ) we can use these structures directly from STL
all the data structures are STL containers

vectors are like arrays but dynamic

vector<int> vec;
the vectors can be resized
by default the size of vectors is 0

segmentation fault in C++ means we are trying to access an unallocted place in memory
