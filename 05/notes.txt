FUNCTIONS

returnType printHello(){
    code . . . . . . 
}

functions are used to reduce redundancy

main function is automatically called by the compiler

void function does not return anything but return the control

FUNCTIONS IN MEMORY in C++

memory is stored in two formats : STACK -> static allocation and HEAP -> dynamic allocation

every function is stored in the stack frame and the call stack calls the functions respectively
once a function is declared the variables in that functions cannot be used out of their scope
i.e. in the main or any other function

the return statement in any function is the final statement, anything after that is not executed

pass by value

only a copy of the argument is passed to the function
