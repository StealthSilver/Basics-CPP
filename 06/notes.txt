BINARY NUMBERS 

number system is the number of digits used while writing digits
computers only understand 0, 1 (base 2) so it runs in binary number system 

numbers are represented as (a * 2^0 + b * 2 ^ 1 + c * 2 ^ 2 + d * 2 ^ 3 + e * 2 ^ 4)

0 -> 0
1 -> 1 
2 -> 10
3 -> 11 
4 -> 100
5 -> 101
6 -> 110
7 -> 111
8 -> 1000
9 -> 1001
10 -> 1010

01.cpp -> decimal in binary numbers 
02.cpp -> binary to decimal conversion 

Two's complement 

to store negative numbers in memory we have to calculate two's complement


for 0101 -> the first 0 is the MSB (most significant bit)
MSB = 0 -> positive 
MSB = 1 -> negative 

to convert negative decimal to binary

step 1: convert to non negative binary
step 2: find the one's complement(reverse all zeros to 1 and 1 to 0)
step 3 : add 1 to the number 

to convert negative binary to decimal 

step 1: find one's complement (reverse all the digits)
step 2: add 1 to the numebr
