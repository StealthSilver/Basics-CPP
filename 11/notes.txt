TIME COMPLEXITY

time complexity is not the actual time taken but the time taken as the function of input size (n)
time  = f(n) -> time complexity

the time complexity let us create scalable systems and let us compare algorithms 

BIG O NOTATION
this represents the upper bound or the worst case complexity

n^2 + n + 1 -> n^2

THETA NOTATION 
this represents the average case time complexity

n^3 + n^2 + n -> n^2

OMEGA NOTATION 
this represents the lower bound or the nest case time compelixity

n^3 + n^2 + n -> n

SPACE COMPLEXITY 

amount of space taken by an algorithm as a function of input size (n)
the input space is not considered, the extra auxillary space which we use is considered
