TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

time complexity is not the actual time taken but the time taken as the function of input size (n)
time  = f(n) -> time complexity

the time complexity let us create scalable systems and let us compare algorithms 

BIG O NOTATION
this represents the upper bound or the worst case complexity

n^2 + n + 1 -> n^2
